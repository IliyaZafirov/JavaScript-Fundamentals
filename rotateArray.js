// Rotate Array
// Write a function that rotates an array. The array should be rotated to the right side, meaning that the last element
// should become the first, upon rotation.
// The input comes as an array of strings. The last element of the array is the amount of rotation you need to
// perform.
// The output is the resulting array after the rotations. The elements should be printed on one line, separated by a
// single space.





function rotate(arr) {

}

rotate(['1', '2', '3', '4', '2'])
