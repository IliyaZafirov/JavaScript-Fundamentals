// You are a pianist, and you like to keep a list of your favorite piano pieces. Create a program to help you organize it and add, change, remove pieces from it!
// On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer n – the number of pieces you will initially have. On the next n lines, the pieces themselves will follow with their composer and key, separated by "|" in the following format: "{piece}|{composer}|{key}".
// Then, you will be receiving different commands, each on a new line, separated by "|", until the "Stop" command is given:
// "Add|{piece}|{composer}|{key}":
// You need to add the given piece with the information about it to the other pieces and print:
// "{piece} by {composer} in {key} added to the collection!"
// If the piece is already in the collection, print:
// "{piece} is already in the collection!"
// "Remove|{piece}":
// If the piece is in the collection, remove it and print:
// "Successfully removed {piece}!"
// Otherwise, print:
// "Invalid operation! {piece} does not exist in the collection."
// "ChangeKey|{piece}|{new key}":
// If the piece is in the collection, change its key with the given one and print:
// "Changed the key of {piece} to {new key}!"
// Otherwise, print:
// "Invalid operation! {piece} does not exist in the collection."
// Upon receiving the "Stop" command, you need to print all pieces in your collection in the following format:
// "{Piece} -> Composer: {composer}, Key: {key}"
// Input/Constraints
// You will receive a single integer at first – the initial number of pieces in the collection.
// For each piece, you will receive a single line of text with information about it.
// Then you will receive multiple commands in the way described above until the command "Stop".
// Output
// All the output messages with the appropriate formats are described in the problem description.
