// *Dungeonest Dark
// As a young adventurer, you seek gold and glory in the darkest dungeons there are.
// You have initial health 100 and initial coins 0. You will be given a string, representing the dungeon's rooms. Each
// room is separated with '|' (vertical bar): "room1|room2|room3…"
// Each room contains - an item or a monster; and a number. They are separated by a single space.
// ("item/monster number").
// • If the first part is "potion":
// o You are healed with the number in the second part. However, your health cannot exceed your
// initial health (100).
// o Print: `You healed for {healing-number} hp.`
// o After that, print your current health: `Current health: {number} hp.`
// • If the first part is "chest":
// o You have found some coins, the number in the second part.
// o Print: `You found {coins} coins.`
// • In any other case, you are facing a monster, you are going to fight.
// The second part of the room contains the attack of the monster, and the first the monster's name. You
// should remove the monster's attack from your health.
// o If you are not dead (health > 0) you have slain the monster, and you should print:
//  `You slayed {monster-name}.`
// o If you have died, print: `You died! Killed by {monster-name}.` and your quest is over.
// Print the best room you`ve to manage to reach: `Best room: {room}`.
// • If you managed to go through all the rooms in the dungeon, print on the next three lines:
// "You've made it!"
// "Coins: {coins}"
// "Health: {health}"
// Input
// You receive an array with one element- string, representing the dungeon's rooms, separated with '|' (vertical bar):
// ["room1|room2|room3…"].
// ...! a game where every hero wins the day with shiny armor and a smile...
