// Problem 2 - Mirror words
// Link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/2307#1
// The SoftUni Spelling Bee competition is here. But it`s not like any other Spelling Bee competition out there. It`s different and a lot more fun! You, of course, are a participant, and you are eager to show the competition that you are the best, so go ahead, learn the rules and win!
// On the first line of the input, you will be given a text string. To win the competition, you have to find all hidden word pairs, read them, and mark the ones that are mirror images of each other.
// First of all, you have to extract the hidden word pairs. Hidden word pairs are:
// Surrounded by "@" or "#" (only one of the two) in the following pattern #wordOne##wordTwo# or @wordOne@@wordTwo@
// At least 3 characters long each (without the surrounding symbols)
// Made up of letters only
// If the second word, spelled backward, is the same as the first word and vice versa (casing matters!), they are a match, and you have to store them somewhere. Examples of mirror words: 
// #Part##traP# @leveL@@Level@ #sAw##wAs#
// If you don`t find any valid pairs, print: "No word pairs found!"
// If you find valid pairs print their count: "{valid pairs count} word pairs found!"
// If there are no mirror words, print: "No mirror words!"
// If there are mirror words print:
// "The mirror words are:
// {wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}, {wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}, â€¦ {wordOne} <=> {wordtwo}"
// Input / Constraints
// You will recive a string.
// Output
// Print the proper output messages in the proper cases as described in the problem description.
// If there are pairs of mirror words, print them in the end, each pair separated by ", ".
// Each pair of mirror word must be printed with " <=> " between the words.
